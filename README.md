## Objective

Inspire organization members to improve their algorithmic problem solving skills


## Key Results

1. More (any) weekly submissions with the leaterboard than before
    - (e.g. Last month 0 problems submitted, this week 30)

2. More (any) accepted submissions with leaterboard than before
    - (e.g. Last month 0 problems solved, this week 10)

3. First time problem solvers starting
    - (e.g. New account creation for solving problems)

4. Harder tier of problem being solved for the first time
    - (e.g. First medium problem done)

5. Problems solved in new categories
    - (e.g. Before 0 "Array" problems solved, now 4)

6. Rank improvement
    - (e.g. Rank 1,000,000 before, now rank 900,000)
    - Get everyone who has solved 1 problem to reach top 1,000,000
